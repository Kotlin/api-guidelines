## Backward compatibility definition

One of the cornerstones of a good API is backward compatibility. Backward-compatible code allows clients of 
newer API versions to use the same API code that they used with an older API version. This section describes 
the main points you should think about to make your API backward compatible.

There are at least three types of compatibility when talking about APIs:
* Source
* Behavioral
* Binary

### Read more about compatibility types {initial-collapse-state="collapsed"}

You can count versions of a library as  **source-compatible** when you're sure that your client's application will recompile 
correctly against a newer version of your library. Usually, it's difficult to implement and check this automatically 
unless the changes are trivial. In any API, there are always corner cases when source compatibility might be broken 
by a particular change.

**Behavioral compatibility** ensures that any new code does not change the semantics of the original code behavior, 
apart from fixing bugs.

A **binary backward-compatible** version of a library can replace a previously compiled version of the library. 
Any software that was compiled against the previous version of the library should continue to work correctly.

It's possible to break binary compatibility without breaking source compatibility and to break source compatibility 
without breaking binary compatibility.

Some principles of keeping binary backward compatibility are obvious: don't just remove parts of a public API, instead, 
[deprecate](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-deprecated/) them. The following sections contain less 
well-known principles.

## "Don't do" recommendations

### Don't add arguments to existing API functions

Adding non-default arguments to a public API is a breaking change because the existing code won't have enough information 
to call the updated methods. Adding even [default arguments](functions.md#default-arguments) might also break 
your users' code.

Breaking backward compatibility is shown below in an example of two classes: `lib.kt` representing a "library", 
`client.kt` representing some "client" of this "library". This construct for libraries and their clients is common 
in real-world applications. In this example, the "library" has one function that computes the fifth member 
of the Fibonacci sequence. The file `lib.kt` contains:

```kotlin
fun fib() = … // Returns the fifth element
```

Let's call this function from another file, `client.kt`:

```kotlin
fun main(){
    println(fib()) // Returns 3
}
```

Let's compile classes:

```none
kotlinc lib.kt client.kt 
```

The compilation results in two files: `LibKt.class` and `ClientKt.class`.

Let's call the client to make sure that it works:

```none
$ kotlin ClientKt.class
3
```

The design is far from perfect and hardcoded for learning purposes. It predefines what element of the sequence you want 
to obtain, which is incorrect and doesn't follow clean code principles. Let's rewrite it preserving the same default behavior: 
returning the fifth element by default. But now it will be possible to provide an element number that you want to get.

`lib.kt`:

```kotlin
fun fib(numberOfElement: Int = 5) = … // Returns requested member
```

Let's recompile only the "library":  `kotlinc lib.kt`.

Let's run the "client":

```none
$ kotlin ClientKt.class
```

The result is:

```none
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: 'int LibKt.fib()'
       at LibKt.main(fib.kt:2)
       at LibKt.main(fib.kt)
       …
```

There is a ` NoSuchMethodError` because the signature of the `fib()` function changed after compilation.

If you recompile `client.kt`, it will work again because it will be aware of the new signature. In this example, 
**binary compatibility was broken while preserving source compatibility**.

{type="note"}

Let's call [`javap`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/specs/man/javap.html) on the `LibKt` class before 
the changes:

```none
❯ javap FiLibKtbKt
Compiled from "lib.kt"
public final class LibKt {
 public static final int fib();
}
```

And after the changes:

```none
❯ javap LibKt
Compiled from "lib.kt"
public final class LibKt {
 public static final int fib(int);
 public static int fib$default(int, int, java.lang.Object);
}
```

The method with signature `public static final int fib()` was replaced with a new method with signature 
`public static final int fib(int)` . At the same time, a proxy method `fib$default` delegates the execution to `fib(int)`. 
For JVM, it's possible to work around this: you need to add a [`@JvmOverloads`](java-to-kotlin-interop.md#overloads-generation) 
annotation. For multiplatform projects, there is unfortunately no workaround.

### Don't use data classes in API

[Data classes](data-classes.md) are tempting to use because they are short, concise, and have some functionality 
out of the box. However, due to some specifics of how data classes work, it's better not to use them in library APIs. 
Almost any change makes the API not backward compatible.

Usually, it's hard to predict how you will need to change a class over time. Even if today you think that it's self-contained, 
there is no way to be sure that your needs won't change in the future. So, all the issues with data classes only exist 
when you decide to change such a class.

Firstly, the considerations from the previous section [Don't add arguments to existing API functions](#don-t-add-arguments-to-existing-api-functions) 
also apply to the constructor as it is also a method. Secondly, even if you add secondary constructors, it won't solve 
the compatibility problem. Let's look at the following data class:

```kotlin
data class User(
    val name: String,
    val email: String
)
```

For example, over some time, you understand that users should go through an activation procedure, so you want to add 
a new field, "active" with a default value equal to "true". This new field should allow the existing code to work 
mostly without changes.

As it was already discussed in the [section above](#don-t-add-arguments-to-existing-api-functions), you can't just add 
a new field like this:

```kotlin
data class User(
    val name: String,
    val email: String,
    val active: Boolean = true
)
```

Because this change is **not binary compatible**.

Let's add a new constructor that accepts only two arguments and calls the primary constructor with a third default argument:

```kotlin
data class User(
    val name: String,
    val email: String,
    val active: Boolean = true
) {
    constructor(name: String, email: String): 
            this(name, email, active = true)
}
```

This time there are two constructors, and a signature of one of them matches the constructor of the class before the change:

```java
public User(java.lang.String, java.lang.String);
```

But the issue is not with the constructor, it's with the `copy` function. Its signature has changed from:

```java
public final User copy(java.lang.String, java.lang.String);
```

To:

```java
public final User copy(java.lang.String, java.lang.String, boolean);
```

And it has made the code **binary incompatible**.

Of course, it's possible just to add a property inside the data class, but it removes all the bonuses of it being 
a data class. Therefore, it's better not to use data classes in your API because almost any change in them breaks source, 
binary, or behavioral compatibility.

If you have to use a data class for whatever reason, you have to override the constructor and the `copy()` method. 
In addition, if you add a field into the class's body, you have to override the `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods.

> It's always an incompatible change to swap the order of arguments because of `componentX()` methods. It breaks source 
> compatibility and probably will break binary compatibility too.

### Don't make return types narrower

Sometimes, especially when you don't use [explicit API mode](whatsnew14.md#explicit-api-mode-for-library-authors), 
a return type declaration can change implicitly. But even if it's not the case, you might want to narrow the signature. 
For example, sometimes you realize that you need index access to the elements of your collection and want to change 
the return type from `Collection` to `RandomAccess`. This section describes why it is a bad idea for a library author 
to make such a change.

Consider a library function in the `library.kt` file:

```kotlin
public fun x(): Number = 3
```

And an example of its use in the `client.kt` file:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    println(x()) // Prints 3
}
```

Let's compile it with `kotlinc library.kt client.kt` and make sure that it works:

```none
$ kotlin ClientKt
3
```

Let's change the return type of the "library" function `x()` from `Number` to `Int`:

```kotlin
fun x(): Int = 3
```

And recompile only the library: `kotlinc library.kt`. `ClientKt` doesn't work as expected anymore. It doesn't print `3` 
and throws an exception instead:

```none
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: 'java.lang.Number Library.x()'
    	at ClientKt.main(call.kt:2)
    	at ClientKt.main(call.kt)
    	…
```

This happens because of the following line in bytecode:

```none
0: invokestatic  #12 // Method Library.x:()Ljava/lang/Number;
```

This line means that you call the static method `x()` returning the type `Number`. But there is no longer 
such a method – **binary compatibility has been violated**.

## The @PublishedApi annotation

Sometimes, you might need to use a part of your internal API to implement [inline functions](inline-functions.md). 
You can do this with the [`@PublishedApi`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-published-api) annotation. 
You should treat parts of code annotated with `@PublishedApi` as parts of public API, and, therefore, you should 
be careful about their backward compatibility.

## The @RequiresOptIn annotation

Sometimes, you might want to experiment with your API. In Kotlin, there is a nice way to define that some API is unstable – 
use the [`@RequiresOptIn` annotation](opt-in-requirements.md#require-opt-in-for-api). However, be aware of the following:
1. If you haven't changed something for a long time and it's stable, you should reconsider using the `@RequiresOptIn` annotation.
2. You may use the `@RequiresOptIn` annotation to define different guarantees to different parts of the API: 
   Preview, Experimental, Internal, Delicate, or Alpha, Beta, RC.
3. You should explicitly define what each [level](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-requires-opt-in/-level/) 
   means, write [KDoc](kotlin-doc.md) comments, and add a warning message.

If you depend on an API requiring opt-in, don't use the `@OptIn` annotation. Instead, use the `@RequiresOptIn` annotation 
so that your user is able to consciously choose what API they want to use and what not.

Another example of `@RequiresOptIn` is when you want to explicitly warn users about the usage of some API. For example, 
if you maintain a library that utilizes Kotlin reflection, you can annotate classes in this library 
with `@RequiresOptIn(RequiresFullKotlinReflection::class)`.

## Explicit API mode

You should try to keep your API as transparent as possible. To force the API to be transparent, use the [explicit API mode](whatsnew14.md#explicit-api-mode-for-library-authors).

Kotlin gives you vast freedom in how you can write code. It is possible not to define types, omit visibility declarations, 
or omit documentation for something. The explicit API mode forces you as a developer to make implicit things explicit. 
By the link above, you can find out how to enable it. Let's try to understand why you might need it:

1. Without an explicit API, it's easier to break backward compatibility:

   ```kotlin
   // version 1
   fun getToken() = 1
   
   // version 1.1
   fun getToken() = "1"
   ```
 
   The return type of `getToken()` changes, but you don't even need to update the signature for it to break users' code — 
   they expect to get `Int`, but they get `String`.

2. The same applies to visibility. If the `getToken()` function is `private`, then backward compatibility is not broken. 
   But without an explicit visibility declaration, it's unclear whether an API user should be able to access it. 
   If they should be able to, it should be declared as `public` and documented; in this case, the change 
   breaks backward compatibility. If not, it should be defined as `private` or `internal`, and this change won't be breaking.

## Tools to enforce backward compatibility

Backward compatibility is a crucial aspect of software development, as it ensures that 
new versions of a library or framework can be used with existing code without causing any issues. 
Maintaining backward compatibility can be a difficult and time-consuming task, especially when dealing with a large codebase 
or complex APIs. It's hard to control it manually, and developers often have to rely on testing and manual inspection 
to ensure that changes do not break existing code. To address this issue, JetBrains created 
the [Binary compatibility validator](#binary-compatibility-validator), and there is also another solution: [japicmp](#japicmp).

> At the moment, both work only for JVM.

{type="note"}

Both solutions have their advantages and disadvantages. japicmp works for any JVM language, and it's both a CLI tool and 
a build system plugin. However, it requires having both old and new applications packaged as JAR files. It's not that easy 
to use when you don't have access to older builds of your library. Also, japicmp gives information on changes 
in Kotlin metadata, which you may not need (because a metadata format is not specified and is considered to be used only 
for Kotlin internal usage).

The Binary compatibility validator works only as a Gradle plugin, and it is on the [Alpha stability level](components-stability.md#stability-levels-explained). 
It doesn't need access to JAR files. It only needs specific dumps of the previous API and the current API. It's capable 
of collecting these dumps itself.
Learn more about these tools below.

### Binary compatibility validator

The [Binary compatibility validator](https://github.com/Kotlin/binary-compatibility-validator) is a tool 
that helps you to ensure the backward compatibility of your libraries and frameworks by automatically detecting 
and reporting any breaking changes in the API. The tool analyzes the library's bytecode before and after you made changes 
and compares the two versions to identify any changes that may break existing code. This makes it easy to detect and 
fix any issues before they become a problem for your users.

It can save a significant amount of time and effort that you would otherwise spend on manual testing and inspection. 
It can also help to prevent issues that may arise due to breaking changes in the API. This can ultimately lead to a better 
user experience, as users will be able to rely on the stability and compatibility of the library or framework.

### japicmp

If you target only JVM as your platform, you can also use [japicmp](https://siom79.github.io/japicmp/). japicmp operates 
on a different level to the Binary compatibility validator: it compares two jar files –old and new– and reports incompatibilities between them.

Be aware that japicmp reports not only incompatibilities but also changes that should not affect a user in any way. 
For example, consider this code:

```kotlin
class Calculator {
    fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
        return a + b
	}

	fun multiply(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
        return a * b
	}
}
```

If you add a new method without breaking the compatibility like this:

```kotlin
class Calculator {
	fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
        return a + b
	}

	fun multiply(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
        return a * b
	}

	fun divide(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
        return a / b
	}
}
```

japicmp reports the following change:

<img src="japicmp-calculator-output.png" alt="Output of japicmp checking compatibility" width="700"/>

It's just a change in the `@Metadata` annotation, which isn't very interesting, but japicmp is JVM-language agnostic and 
has to report everything it sees.
